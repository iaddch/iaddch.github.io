  <h1>'Street Heroes' in movies</h1>
  <p>Below we listed the most iconic Marvel 'Street' superheroes who have movies about them in the Marvel Universe.</p>
  <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>style="font-size: 24px;">Spider-Man (Peter Parker)</strong>
            <p>Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man, is a teenager from Queens, New York who got bit by a radioactive spider in a lab where he earned his 'spider-like' powers. His uncle, Ben, played a big role in his life and taught him his biggest lesson that “with great power comes great responsibility.”  Ben got shot in the streets of Queens and passed away. Afterwards, Peter becomes a street-level hero, protecting the streets of New York City from crime. Unlike any regular superhero, Spider-Man is more focused on local threats, using abilities like the "spidey sense," his super strength, and his ability to shoot spider webs from his wrists to keep innocent citizens safe while balancing his teenage life.
